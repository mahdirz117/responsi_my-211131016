    <p>Hello, I'm Mahdi Romzuz Zaki, Organizing and ensuring an event runs well and smoothly is my job. As someone who works in a philanthropic institution, especially in the IT Media division, I am required to be creative, flexible and disciplined. Armed with Information Systems education at STIKI Malang, I learned a lot about how an organization runs, understand management in an organization, and can map SWOT & POAC analysis well so that I can achieve organizational goals.</p>
